/**
 * Encapsulation and Inheritance
 *
 * 🗒Encapsulation: Restricting direct access to an object's data and modifying it through
 * controlled methods (getters, setters, or behaviors)
 *
 * 🗒Inherirance: Allows a subclass to extend the properties and behaviors of a parent class.
 * 👉 Parent: Task is parent and define attributes and methods
 * 👉 Subclass: WorkTask is a subclass that extends Task, inheriting its fields and methods while adding new
 * behavior
 * 👉 Reusability: Instead of rewriting the same logic, WorkTask will reuse Task's methods to enhance them.
