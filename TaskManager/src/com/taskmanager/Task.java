 *
 * ðŸ—’Inherirance: Allows a subclass to extend the properties and behaviors of a parent class.
 * ðŸ‘‰ Parent: Task is parent and define attributes and methods
 * ðŸ‘‰ Subclass: WorkTask is a subclass that extends Task, inheriting its fields and methods while adding new
 * behavior
 * ðŸ‘‰ Reusability: Instead of rewriting the same logic, WorkTask will reuse Task's methods to enhance them.
