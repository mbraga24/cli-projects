/**
 * üß© Strategy Pattern | Behavioral Pattern
 * Allows selecting an algorithm dynamically at runtime.
 * The TaskSorter uses the Strategy Pattern to allow sorting by different criteria (due date, title, etc.) dynamically.
 *
 * Separating classes for each strategy:
 *  ‚úÖ Pros:
 * Scalability: Easy to add new strategies.
 * Open/Closed Principle (OOP Best Practice): New sorting strategies don't require modifying existing code/class.
 * Encapsulation: Each class does one job, keeping the code clean.
 * Polymorphism: Easily to swap sorting strategies at runtime using TaskSorter instances
 * ‚ùé Cos:
 * More files: Creates multiple small classes
 * Slightly More Boilerplate: each strategy needs its own file
